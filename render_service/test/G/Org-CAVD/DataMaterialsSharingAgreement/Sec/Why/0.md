1.sec=WHEREAS, each Party is a member of a {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} in the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery ({_CAVD}) - a network of centers and consortia funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (the Foundation), to support the implementation of the scientific strategic plan of the {_Global_HIV_Vaccine_Enterprise} (the Enterprise).

2.sec=WHEREAS, the Parties include public and private entities, including agencies of sovereign nations and intergovernmental organizations, whose compliance with specific terms of this Agreement may be conditioned by legal limitations.

3.sec=WHEREAS, the members of each {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} have entered or will enter into separate agreement(s) among themselves that include a global access strategy and, as appropriate, collaboration agreement and project management committee charter that governs the performance of the corresponding research project funded by the Foundation.

4.sec=WHEREAS, the {_CAVD} is not a separate legal entity, but is a series of research projects funded by the Foundation in order to create an HIV vaccine discovery collaborative network.

5.sec=WHEREAS, the agreements needed to establish the {_CAVD}’s HIV vaccine discovery collaborative network as a working collaboration will be based on the “Guiding Principles” as set out in Section 2 below.

6.sec=WHEREAS, the {_CAVD} consists of such centers or consortia (referred to herein, and further defined below, as the {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia}), each of which falls within one of two categories: (i) Vaccine Discovery Consortia ({_VDC}s) focusing on the research and development of candidate HIV vaccines designed to stimulate humoral or/and cell-mediated immune responses; and (ii) Central Service Facilities (collectively the {_CSF}s) that conduct research and provide services in support of the vaccine discovery goals.

7.sec=WHEREAS, the {_CSF}s include Vaccine Immune Monitoring Centers (VIMCs) which focus on either humoral or cell-mediated immune evaluation; an HIV Specimen Cryorepository (HSC); and a Vaccine Immunology Statistical Center (VISC).

8.sec=WHEREAS, it is expected that the {_Funded_Centers_or_Consortia} will work in full collaboration, united by a robust system for the exchange of {_Data} and {_Material}s, and supported, as appropriate, by Alliance Management.

9.sec=WHEREAS, each of the Parties acknowledge that the primary goals of the {_CAVD}, consistent with those of the Enterprise, are to (i) accelerate the development of an HIV vaccine through the development and use of innovative technologies and consistent laboratory practices, and (ii) to conduct activities within the {_CAVD_Project}s in a manner that is consistent with and in furtherance of the {_Global_Access_Objective}s.
