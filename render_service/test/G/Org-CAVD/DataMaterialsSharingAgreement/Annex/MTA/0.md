2.Ti=TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT

2.1.sec=The terms and conditions of this Master MTA include the provisions set forth below, as well as the provisions of the Guiding Principles which are incorporated by reference and made a part of this Master MTA. In the event that there are any conflicts between the provisions set forth below and those set forth in the Guiding Principles, the provisions of the Guiding Principles shall control except as otherwise expressly stated in this Master MTA.

2.2.sec=Transfer of all {_Material}s by {_CAVD_Member}s under this Master MTA shall be documented through the completion of the {_Material} Transfer Record Forms (in the form as contained in Attachment B), a copy of which will be provided by the {_Provider} to the {_Alliance_Manager} for each {_Material} transfer. Upon each Material Transfer Record Form, the {_Provider} shall, among other things, describe the {_Material} and set forth the additional terms and conditions of the use and the transfer of the {_Material}s. {_Material} transfers among members or collaborators of a single {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} are regulated by the provisions of internal collaboration agreements or material transfer agreements, although each {_Funded_Center_or_Consortium} may elect to have this Master MTA govern {_Material} transfers between their own collaborators.

2.3.sec=The {_Recipient} agrees that {_Material}s (a) will not be used in human subjects, in clinical trials, or for diagnostic purposes involving human subjects unless such use is expressly approved by the {_Provider} in writing and the {_Recipient}’s use shall be in accordance with the appertaining clinical protocol, informed consent and subject to any required Institutional Review Board and / or Ethics Committee approvals and / or other necessary approvals as applicable; (b) will not be used for {_Commercial_Purpose}s; and (c) will only be used by individuals who are legally obligated, in the manner and to the extent required in the applicable Material Transfer Record Forms, to allocate their respective right in any and all {_CAVD_Invention}s (and any patent rights or other rights arising therefrom); and (d) will not be given or made available to {_CAVD_Member}s or third parties unless approval to do so has been given on the respective Material Transfer Record Form by the {_Provider} and in which case such transfer will also be under the conditions of this Master MTA, and subject to the approval of the originator of the materials.

2.4.sec=It is acknowledged that the results of the research using the {_Material}s may be important to the {_Provider} in its attempts to attract good researchers and secure research funding for HIV vaccine-related or other research. Such recognition may be primarily established by reference to the use of {_Material}s by third parties, such as the {_Recipient}, in Publications. It is further acknowledged that the failure to obtain such recognition may adversely affect the {_Provider}’s ongoing research activities and funding. Accordingly, the {_Recipient} hereby agrees that it will notify the {_Provider} and, at least 30 days prior to submission, provide a copy of any Publication concerning the research in which such {_Material}s were utilized to the {_Provider}. The {_Recipient} shall reasonably consider any comments the {_Provider} offers and will make appropriate attributions (co-authorship or acknowledgement) in all such Publications where the {_Provider}’s {_Material}s were used in the {_Recipient}’s research.

2.5.1.sec=(a) It is understood and agreed that the attachments to this Master MTA, and the {_CAVD} {_Data} & {_Material}s Sharing Agreement, set forth certain other provisions regarding confidentiality, the sharing of research results, {_CAVD_Invention}s, the scientific and charitable goals of the {_CAVD_Project}s, and other related issues and appertaining activities under this Master MTA.

2.5.2.sec=(b) The use and allocation of ownership or licensing, if any, of the {_Material}s and {_CAVD_Invention}s arising through the use of the {_Material}s is addressed in the applicable Material Transfer Record Forms. Such ownership or licensing provisions shall survive termination of the Master MTA and shall apply to further transfers of the {_Material} by the {_Recipient} as applicable.

2.15.sec=No waiver of any term, provision or condition of the Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of the same term, provision or condition, or of any other term, provision or condition of this Agreement.

2.16.sec=No party shall be liable for any failure to perform as required by the Agreement to the extent such failure to perform is due to circumstances reasonably beyond such party’s control, including, without limitation, labor disturbances or labor disputes of any kind, accident, civil disorders or commotions, acts of aggression or terrorism, acts of God, energy or other conservation measures imposed by law or regulation, explosions, failure of utilities, mechanical breakdowns, material shortages, disease, or other such occurrences.

2.=[G/Z/ol/s16]

2 EXW is an Incoterm abbreviation for “EX Works.” Ex works means that the {_Provider} delivers when he places the goods at the disposal of the {_Recipient} at the {_Provider}’s premises or another named place (i.e. works, factory, warehouse, etc.) not cleared for export and not loaded on any collecting vehicle. This term thus represents the minimum obligation for the {_Provider}, and the {_Recipient} has to bear all costs and risks involved in taking the goods from the {_Provider}’s premises.
