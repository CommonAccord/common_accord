Ti=Appeal

Rules.sec=In accordance with the Rules.

Rules.sec/Note=Do not provide an appeal option.

None.sec=No appeal may be made from the award.

None.sec/Note=Hazardj adding this because it seems more direct than a reference to Rules that do not provide for appeal.  I understand this to be the same effect, but clearer.

AppellateRules.sec=Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in the contract documents, the parties hereby agree: that the Underlying Award may be appealed pursuant to the AAA's Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules ("Appellate Rules"); that the Underlying Award rendered by the {arbitrator(s)} shall, at a minimum, be a reasoned award; and that the Underlying Award shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of an Underlying Award, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. Following the appeal process the decision rendered by the appeal tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
