Informed.sec=Privacy respecting and enhancing services rely on the principle that individuals are informed about the details and potential benefits and consequences  associated with personal information management. Informed individuals are likely to make better decisions about how their personal information is provided, shared, and used. Informed consent requires that individuals have a clear understanding of the facts, implications, and potential consequences of an action. Informed consent is gained by providing an individual with the knowledge and tools to securely manage access to their personal information.

Easy.sec=Digital identity ecosystem services and tools must be easy to use. Remembering dozens of passwords or carrying 15 different cards is not a scalable or secure approach. If an individual forgets their password (or other identifier) or loses their identification (or device upon which it is stored) they must be able to securely and conveniently re-validate their digital identity with ecosystem services. Digital identity ecosystem services must be secure enough to prevent fraud and convenient enough to allow for rapid authentication and access control.
