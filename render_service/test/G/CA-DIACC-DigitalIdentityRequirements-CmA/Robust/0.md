Ti=Robust, secure, scalable;

Available.sec=Canadaâ€™s digital identity ecosystem must be robust enough to ensure it is secure, available, and accessible at all times. Full time services access also requires redundancy and disaster recovery tools.

Secure.sec=The ecosystem infrastructure must enable the digital services delivery and economic sectors to adopt the latest advances in security technologies and policies. Protecting personal information is a non-negotiable priority. Infrastructure design must secure personal information that is both in transit and at rest. Infrastructure must rely on a foundation of awareness and training for expertise including: access control, audit and accountability, risk assessment, penetration testing, and vulnerability management.

Scalable.sec=A trust framework that governs digital identity ecosystem solutions and services must scale to securely enable innovation. Some entities are ready to accept digital identities while others are not. A digital identity ecosystem trust framework must be designed to enable the service delivery and economic sectors to integrate at scale.
