3.Ti=Limitations on Effect of Force Majeure

3.sec=In no event will any delay or failure of performance caused by any conditions or events of Force Majeure extend this Agreement beyond its stated term. In the event of any delay or failure of performance caused by conditions or events of Force Majeure, which would otherwise constitute an Event of Default pursuant to Section 10, the cure provisions of Section 10 shall not apply and such delay or failure of performance, if not previously cured, shall be extended day-for-day by the event of Force Majeure; provided that such delay or failure shall become an Event of Default one (1) year from the date of notice provided for in Section 10. The other Party may, at any time following the end of such one-year period, terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the affected Party, without further obligation by the terminating Party except as to costs and unpaid balances incurred prior to the effective date of such termination. The other Party may, but shall not be obligated to, extend such one year period, for such additional time as it, at its sole discretion, deems appropriate, if the affected Party is exercising due diligence in its efforts to cure the conditions or events of Force Majeure.

The notice shall specify the length of any extension to a performance deadline to which Seller feels entitled.
