(scroll down a bit, there is no anchor for Shareholders' Agreement.

Majority.sec=A shareholders’ agreement (the “{_Agreement}”) will be entered into on the Closing date among the {_Founders}, the {_Seed_Investors} owning more than {5%_of_the_share_capital} and the {_New_Investors}, for a term of 15 years renewable.  The {_Agreement} will replace and supersede in all respect any and all pre-existing shareholders agreements entered into between the shareholders of the {_Company}.  The {_Agreement} shall automatically terminate upon the listing of the {_Company}’s shares on a regulated market or a foreign stock exchange/ a {_Qualifying_IPO}. 

Minority.sec=All other shareholders including {_Seed_Investors} owning less than {5%_of_the_share_capital} and option holders (the "{_Minority_Holders}") shall sign with the parties to the {_Agreement} (represented for this purpose by the {_Company}) a separate, shorter shareholders’ agreement under which the {_Minority_Holders} shall have a full tag along right in case of transfer of more than 50% of the shares of the {_Company} and, in return, shall be subject to all major obligations provided for in the {_Agreement}. Also, the {_Minority_Holders} will agree in such short-form shareholders agreement to be bound by the terms of any lock-up obligation which the banks in charge of the IPO and the {_Board} may reasonably see fit.
