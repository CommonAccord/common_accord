[Explanatory Note: Note that consensus-based decision-making is consistent with cooperative principles, however, there is no statutory requirement that cooperatives must use consensus-based decision-making.  In some situations, it might make more sense to use a simple-majority or three-fourths vote.  Cooperatives that use consensus-based decision-making may also wish to adopt a much more detailed set of processes and guidelines for how proposals will be made and considered.  For a sample of a detailed consensus policy, see Tree Bressen’s Sample Consensus Process Policy at http://treegroup.info/topics/consensus-in-sharing-law.pdf]
