Note=We specify the ICC arbitration clause for resolution of disputes with a mediation stage followed by arbitration.  To highlight the clause for the demo, we make it red.  The full range of arbitration choices for the ICC and AAA are available.

Note=Here we make the substitution:

Dispute.sec=<span class="missing">{ICC-Arb.MediationClauseC.sec}</span>

Note=This links to the Chatham House DSA with the alternative arbitration solutions.
