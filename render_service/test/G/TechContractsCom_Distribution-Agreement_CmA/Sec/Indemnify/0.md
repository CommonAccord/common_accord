Ti=INDEMNIFICATION 

1.Ti=From Provider

1.sec=Provider shall defend and indemnify Distributor and Distributor’s Associates (as defined below in Section {3.Xnum}) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding arising out of, related to, or alleging direct infringement of any patent, copyright, trade secret, or other intellectual property right by the Licensed Software. Provider’s obligations set forth in this Section {1.Xnum} do not apply to the extent that an Indemnified Claim arises out of: (a) Distributor’s breach of this Agreement; (b) revisions to the Licensed Software made without Provider’s written consent; (c) Distributor’s failure to incorporate Upgrades that would have avoided the alleged infringement, provided Provider offered such Upgrades without charges not otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement; (d) Provider’s modification of Licensed Software in compliance with specifications provided by Distributor; or (e) use of the Licensed Software in combination with hardware or software not provided by Provider. In the event of an Indemnified Claim, Provider may exercise any of the remedies set forth in Subsections {Indemnify.1.2.Xnum}(i) through {Indemnify.1.2.Xnum}(iii) above, including without limitation its right therein to terminate licenses.

2.Ti=From Distributor

2.sec=Distributor shall defend and indemnify Provider and Provider’s Associates (as defined below in Section {3.Xnum}) against any “Indemnified Claim,” meaning any third party claim, suit, or proceeding: (a) by any Sub-Distributor or End-Customer, as well as any such entity’s employee, contractor, or other end user; (b) related to the Value-Added Product; or (c) arising out of, related to, or alleging any of the actions listed in Subsections {1.Xnum} (a) through (e) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such claim, suit, or proceeding shall be considered an Indemnified Claim pursuant to this Section {2.Xnum} to the extent that it arises out of, relates to, or alleges: (i) intellectual property infringement by the Licensed Software; or (ii) an injury caused by the Licensed Software’s failure to conform to its Documentation or Specifications. For the avoidance of doubt, Indemnified Claims do not include claims related to injuries to the extent caused by the Licensed Software’s failure to perform as represented by Distributor or a Sub-Distributor but not by the Documentation or Specifications.

3.Ti=Litigation & Additional Terms

3.sec=The obligations of the indemnifying party (“Indemnitor”) pursuant to Section {1.Xnum} or {2.Xnum} above: (a) include retention and payment of attorneys and payment of court costs, as well as settlement at Indemnitor’s expense and payment of judgments; and (b) will be excused to the extent that the other contracting party’s (“Indemnified Party’s”) or any of such Indemnified Party’s Associates’ failure to provide prompt notice of the Indemnified Claim or reasonably to cooperate materially prejudices the defense. Indemnitor will control the defense of any Indemnified Claim, including appeals, negotiations, and any settlement or compromise thereof; provided Indemnified Party will have the right, not to be exercised unreasonably, to reject any settlement or compromise that requires that it admit wrongdoing or liability or subjects it to any ongoing affirmative obligations. (As used in this Article {Xnum}, a party’s “Associates” are its officers, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, agents, successors, and assigns. Distributor’s “Associates” also include Sub-Distributors and End-Customers, provided each such Sub-Distributor or End-Customer was rightfully licensed pursuant to this Agreement.)
