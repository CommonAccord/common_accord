5.2.Ti=Automatic Conversion

5.2.sec=Each outstanding share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted, without any further act of the Corporation or its stockholders, into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price then in effect upon the closing of an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offering and sale of the Common Stock for the account of the Corporation in which the aggregate gross proceeds received by the Corporation equals or exceeds {Convert.Automatic.GrossProceeds.$}.

5.3.Ti=Conversion at Option of the Corporation

5.3.sec=Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, and subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this paragraph 5, at the option of the Corporation, each outstanding share of Preferred Stock may be converted into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Price then in effect if the Corporation has executed a definitive agreement for sale of the Company, or a firmly underwritten public offering of common equity in which the aggregate price paid by the acquiring company or by the public for such for all of the issued and outstanding Common Stock and shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of any options, warrants or rights or conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities is at least {Convert.Automatic.GrossProceeds.$} (net of underwriting discounts, commissions and related offering expenses).

5.4.Ti=Conversion Price

5.4.sec=Each share of Preferred Stock shall be converted into a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing (i) the Subscription Price by (ii) the Conversion Price in effect on the Conversion Date. The Conversion Price at which shares of Common Stock shall initially be issuable upon conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock shall be the Subscription Price. The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as set forth in subparagraph 5(g). No payment or adjustment shall be made for any dividends on the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

5.5.Ti=Mechanics of Conversion

5.5.sec=The holder of any shares of Preferred Stock may exercise the conversion right specified in subparagraph 5(a) by surrendering to the Corporation or any transfer agent of the Corporation the certificate or certificates for the shares to be converted, accompanied by written notice specifying the number of shares to be converted. Upon the occurrence of the events specified in subparagraphs (b) or (c), the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; provided that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue to any such holder certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless certificates evidencing the shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or any transfer agent of the Corporation. Conversion shall be deemed to have been effected on the date when delivery of notice of an election to convert and certificates for shares is made pursuant to subparagraph 5(a) or on the date of the occurrence of the events specified in subparagraphs 5(b) or 5(c), as the case may be, and such date is referred to herein as the “Conversion Date.” Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 5(g)(vii), as promptly as practicable thereafter (and after surrender of the certificate or certificates representing shares of Preferred Stock to the Corporation or any transfer agent of the Corporation in the case of conversions pursuant to subparagraphs 5(b) or 5(c)) the Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of such holder a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled and a check or cash with respect to any fractional interest in a share of Common Stock as provided in subparagraph 5(e). Subject to the provisions of subparagraph 5(g)(vii), the person in whose name the certificate or certificates for Common Stock are to be issued shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of such Common Stock on the applicable Conversion Date. Upon conversion of only a portion of the number of shares covered by a certificate representing shares of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion (in the case of conversion pursuant to subparagraph 5(a)), the Corporation shall issue and deliver to or upon the written order of the holder of the certificate so surrendered for conversion, at the expense of the Corporation, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Preferred Stock representing the unconverted portion of the certificate so surrendered.

5.6.Ti=Fractional Shares

5.6.sec=No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be issued upon conversion of shares of Preferred Stock. If more than one share of Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for conversion at any one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock so surrendered. Instead of any fractional shares of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fractional interest in an amount equal to that fractional interest of the then Current Market Price.

5.7.Ti=Conversion Price Adjustments

5.7.0.sec=The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

5.7.1.Ti=Common Stock Issued at Less Than the Conversion Price

5.7.0.sec=If the Corporation shall issue any Common Stock other than Excluded Stock (as hereinafter defined) without consideration or for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to each such issuance shall immediately (except as provided below) be reduced to the price determined by dividing (1) an amount equal to the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such issuance multiplied by the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and (B) the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation upon such issuance, by (2) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issuance.<br>For the purposes of any adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to clause (i), the following provisions shall be applicable:

5.7.1.Ti=Cash

5.7.1.sec=In the case of the issuance of Common Stock for cash, the amount of the consideration received by the Corporation shall be deemed to be the amount of the cash proceeds received by the Corporation for such Common Stock before deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions, taxes or other expenses allowed, paid or incurred by the Corporation for any underwriting or otherwise in connection with the issuance and sale thereof.

5.7.2.Ti=Consideration Other Than Cash

5.7.3.Ti=Options and Convertible Securities.

5.7.3.0.sec=In the case of the issuance of (i) options, warrants or other rights to purchase or acquire Common Stock (whether or not at the time exercisable), (ii) securities by their terms convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (whether or not at the time so convertible or exchangeable) or options, warrants or rights to purchase such convertible or exchangeable securities (whether or not at the time exercisable):

options, warrants or rights (excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends), plus the additional consideration (determined in the manner provided in subclauses (A) and (B) above), if any, to be received by the Corporation upon the conversion or exchange of such securities, or upon the exercise of any related options, warrants or rights to purchase or acquire such convertible or exchangeable securities and the subsequent conversion or exchange thereof;

5.7.3.4.sec=on the expiration or cancellation of any such options, warrants or rights, or the termination of the right to convert or exchange such convertible or exchangeable securities, if the Conversion Price shall have been adjusted upon the issuance thereof, the Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon the issuance of such options, warrants, rights or such convertible or exchangeable securities on the basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued upon the exercise of such options, warrants or rights, or upon the conversion or exchange of such convertible or exchangeable securities; and

5.7.3.5.sec=if the Conversion Price shall have been adjusted upon the issuance of any such options, warrants, rights or convertible or exchangeable securities, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made for the actual issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof;

5.7.3.sec=If the Corporation shall (i) declare a dividend or make a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of its Common Stock, (ii) subdivide or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (iii) combine or reclassify the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted so that the holder of any shares of Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion after such date shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock which he would have owned or been entitled to receive had such Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to such date. Successive adjustments in the Conversion Price shall be made whenever any event specified above shall occur.

5.7.4.Ti=Other Distributions

5.7.4.sec=In case the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (i) of shares of any class other than its Common Stock or (ii) of evidence of indebtedness of the Corporations or any Subsidiary or (iii) of assets (excluding cash dividends or distributions, and dividends or distributions referred to in subparagraph 5(g) (iii) above), or (iv) of rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in subparagraph 5(g) (i) above), in each such case the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be reduced immediately thereafter to the price determined by dividing (1) an amount equal to the difference resulting from (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Conversion Price per share on such record date, less (B) the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive) of said shares or evidences of indebtedness or assets or rights or warrants to be so distributed, by (2) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed.

If, and so long as, any Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock are then convertible is listed on any national securities exchange, the Corporation will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange, list and keep listed on such exchange, upon official notice of issuance, all shares of such Common Stock issuable upon conversion.
