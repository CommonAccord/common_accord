Ti=SUMMARY

1.sec=The P2B1(beta) Information Sharing Agreement is a legally binding agreement between you and the website or service that you are using. It will be the only agreement that governs how the website will collect and use any of your personal information and will override any other privacy policy that the website may have if it conflicts with the agreement.

2.sec=According to the P2B1(beta) agreement, the website will only collect and use your personal data for the purposes that you have consented to in writing. Even then, it will only collect the bare minimum that is necessary for those purposes. The website will only use cookies (or similar technologies), on the condition that those cookies will be used only to ensure that the website functions properly. Furthermore, the website agrees to do the best they can do ensure that any other party with whom they share any of your personal data will also comply with this agreement. The website agrees not to use your personal data for any advertising purpose and will not allow any third parties to track your use of that website.

3.sec=Once it has collected your personal information in accordance with the paragraph above, the website may also decide to “process” your information. Processing basically means doing anything with that information. In doing so, the website agrees that it will comply with Section 7 of a European Union law called the General Data Protection Regulation, regardless of whether European law would ordinarily apply to the website or not. That provision says that the website must be able to show that you have consented whenever it tries to do anything with your personal information. You may also withdraw your consent at any time.

4.sec=The website further agrees that it may only process your personal information for the purposes to which you have consented to and will only do the minimum amount necessary to achieve that purpose. It agrees that it will be lawful, fair, and transparent when processing your data. At your request, the website must provide you with access to your personal data and tell you whether or not it is processing that data. The website must keep data that is accurate and up to date and must erase or anonymize any data that is no longer necessary. Finally, the website also agrees that it will do the best it can to store data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation mentioned above as well. The website also agrees to take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized, unlawful processing or accidental loss or damage.
