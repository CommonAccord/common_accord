Ti=Damages

sec=If you breach any of the {_Agreement} terms, I shall recover {LiquidatedDamage.$} for each violation as liquidated damages. A violation includes, but is not limited to, each instance of the website or a third party on the website tracking, collecting, selling, sharing, or improperly retaining my activity or information. We agree that quantifying the losses arising from the websiteâ€™s breach is inherently difficult and stipulate that the agreed-upon amount is a reasonable measure of damages.
