Ti=Dispute Resolution

sec=In the case of a claim arising from the {_Agreement} involving only one claimant seeking monetary damages of less than {Dispute.CourtCase.MinThreshold.$}, we agree to resolve the dispute exclusively through the use of online dispute resolution. Neither {_Party}, however, is prevented from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. If any claimant is seeking {Dispute.CourtCase.MinThreshold.$} or more in monetary damages or if the alleged breach involves more than one claimant, I have the option of resolving the matter through online dispute resolution or by filing a claim in court.
