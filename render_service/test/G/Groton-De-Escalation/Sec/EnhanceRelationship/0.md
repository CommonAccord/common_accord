Ti=Contractual Commitment to Enhance A Partnering Relationship

/=Some people, particularly in the construction industry, believe that the best partnering relationships are founded on an explicit contractual commitment of good faith and reasonable (or fair) dealing. The laws of many countries impose an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing in every contract. If the parties want to contractually confirm this kind of relationship, they can include an explicit contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, along the following lines: 

0.sec=The parties, with a positive commitment to honesty and integrity, agree to the following mutual duties:

1.sec=Each will assist in the other’s performance;

2.sec=Each will avoid hindering the other’s performance;

3.sec=Each will proceed to fulfil its obligations diligently;

4.sec=Each will cooperate in the common endeavour of the contract.
