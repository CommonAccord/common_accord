1.sec=In case any one or more of the provisions, subsections, or sentences contained in this {_Agreement} will, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of this {_Agreement}, and this {_Agreement} will be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained in this {_Agreement}.  

2.sec=If moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this {_Agreement} will for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it will be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law as it will then appear.
