Ti=PARTY-APPOINTED ARBITRATORS

0.sec=It is a common practice for each side to appoint an arbitrator and for the two party-appointed arbitrators to then appoint the Chair of the panel. Rule 7(c) of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Arbitration Rules") requires that party-appointed arbitrators "shall be neutral and independent of the appointing Party unless the Parties have agreed that they shall be non-neutral." Set forth below is a clause that effectively provides for party-appointed arbitrators:

1.sec=Within 15 days after the commencement of arbitration, each party shall select one person to act as arbitrator, and the two so selected shall select a third arbitrator within 30 days of the commencement of the arbitration. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator within the allotted time, the third arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS in accordance with its rules. All arbitrators shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrators.

Optional

2.sec=Each party shall communicate its choice of a party-appointed arbitrator only to the JAMS Case Manager in charge of the filing. Neither party is to inform any of the arbitrators as to which of the parties may have appointed them.
