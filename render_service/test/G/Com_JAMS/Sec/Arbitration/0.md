Ti=STANDARD ARBITRATION CLAUSES

0.md=JAMS has standard clauses separately providing for submission of domestic and international disputes to arbitration. While these clauses set forth no details as to procedures to be followed in connection with any such arbitrations, they provide a simple means of assuring that any future dispute will be arbitrated. An additional benefit is that it is sometimes easier for contracting parties to agree to simple, straightforward clauses than to some of the more complex provisions that are set forth in subsequent sections of this Guide. The standard JAMS clauses are set forth below.
