Ti=APPEAL

0.1.sec=In Hall Street Associates v. Mattel Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court held that grounds for a court's vacating an arbitration award under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") are limited to the unlikely occurrences specified in the FAA, such as "evident partiality," "fraud," "corruption," refusing to hear "pertinent and material" evidence, and acts exceeding the powers of the arbitrators. 

0.2.0.sec=Despite Hall Street, the option still remains for parties to appeal to a second panel of arbitrators (as opposed to a court) on the basis of traditional legal principles. One such approach that achieves this goal is set forth in the JAMS Optional Appeal Procedure ("Appeal Procedure"), which permits a meaningful, cost-effective, expeditious appeal based on the same legal principles as would have pertained in an appeal following a trial before a court or jury. More particularly, the Appeal Procedure provides:

0.2.1.sec=That an appeal may be taken to a separate panel of three JAMS arbitrators (or a single arbitrator if the parties so agree).

0.2.2.sec=That the standard of review will be the "same standardâ€¦that the first-level appellate court in the jurisdiction would apply to an appeal from the trial court decision."

0.2.3.sec=That a decision will be rendered within 21 days of oral argument or service of final briefs, which will not exceed 25 double-spaced pages.

0.3.sec=In order to incorporate the above-described appeal into an arbitration, one need only provide in the dispute resolution clause of a commercial contract that:
