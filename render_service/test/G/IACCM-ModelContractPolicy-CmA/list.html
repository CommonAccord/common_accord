<center><font color="red">DRAFT - HYPOTHETICAL -  FOR DISCUSSION ONLY</font><br><b>IACCM MODEL COLLABORATIVE CONTRACTING POLICY</b></center><br><br>

The policy is intended to be used by an enterprise with its business partners and suppliers, including its outside lawyers.  Within the enterprise, the "owner" of the policy is the legal department.<br><br>

The policy takes a "defensive" perspective:  it presumes that the enterprise is receiving a proposal for contract text from a partner, customer or supplier.  The policy acts as a quality-control filter for these incoming materials.  This is distinguished from an offensive policy - one that requires the other party to use forms proposed by the enterprise.  The "defensive" posture encourages contributions and guides the collaboration towards standards formation.<br><br>

This guides the other party to use existing materials but leaves open the possibility that the other party will have good reasons to propose to do things differently. Those proposals may have merit and may improve or expand the contract solutions. <br><br>

The policy highlights the extent to which standards are needed to avoid confusion, risk and needless work.  Enterprises are rightly concerned with being infected by inappropriate or malicious contract terms.  Variations, even benevolent ones, create complexity that is expensive to manage.  Forms and style rules reduce their exposure and increase their ability to focus on their business and relationships.<br><br>

The policy seeks to encourage reuse on three levels:<ol><li>Reuse of forms - a list of forms that the enterprise is comfortable with;<li>Reuse of clauses - libraries of contract components (mostly sections) that can be used as bricks, and<li>Consistent formats - a style guide and aids for drafting. </ol>  It encourages codification by borrowing a secure method of collaboration from software engineering and linking it to the IACCM and CommonAccord's public libraries of "Prose Objects".</ol>
 
The policy itself is a document standard that uses the modular formats and versioning it recommends.
