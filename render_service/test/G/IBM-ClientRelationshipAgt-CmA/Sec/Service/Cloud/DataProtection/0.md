Ti=Data Protection for {_Cloud_Services}

1.sec=Each {_Cloud_Service} is designed to protect content that {P2.Handle} inputs into the {_Cloud_Service}. Except for account data, {P2.Handle} is the sole controller for any personal data included in the content, and appoints {P1.Handle} as a processor to process such personal data (as those terms are defined in EU Directive 95/46/EC). Except as otherwise specified in an {_Attachment_or_TD}, {P1.Handle} will treat content as confidential by not disclosing content other than to {P1.Handle} employees and contractors for use only to the extent needed to deliver the {_Cloud_Service}. {P1.Handle} will return or destroy it upon the expiration or cancellation of the {_Cloud_Service}, or earlier upon {P2.Handle}’s request. {P1.Handle} may charge for certain activities performed at {P2.Handle}’s request (such as delivering content in a specific format). Content is not subject to any separate confidentiality agreement between the {_parties}.

2.sec=The {_Attachment_or_TD} for each {_Cloud_Service} describes the security functions and features of the {_Cloud_Service}. By using the {_Cloud_Service} {P2.Handle} acknowledges that it meets {P2.Handle}’s requirements and processing instructions. {P1.Handle} will provide {P2.Handle} notice of any unauthorized {_third_party} access to {P2.Handle}’s content of which {P1.Handle} becomes aware and will use reasonable efforts to remediate identified security vulnerabilities. If {P2.Handle}’s content is lost or damaged, {P1.Handle} will assist {P2.Handle} in restoring it to the {_Cloud_Service} from {P2.Handle}’s last available backup copy in compatible format. {P1.Handle} may use processors and subprocessors (including personnel and resources) in locations worldwide to deliver the {_Cloud_Services}. {P1.Handle} may transfer {P2.Handle}’s personal data across country borders including outside the European Economic Area (EEA). A list of countries where content may be processed for a {_Cloud_Service} is available at www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters or as described in the {_Attachment_or_TD}. A list of subprocessors is available upon request.

3.sec=Upon request by either {_party}, {P1.Handle}, {P2.Handle} or their affiliates will enter into additional agreements required by law for the protection of personal data included in content such as the standard unmodified EU Model Clauses agreement pursuant to EC Decision 2010/87/EU with optional clauses removed. The {_parties} agree (and will procure that their respective affiliates agree) that such additional agreements will be subject to the terms of {_the_Agreement}.

4.sec={P1.Handle}, its affiliates, and their {_third_party} suppliers may process, store, and use account data wherever they do business to enable product features, administer use, personalize experience, and otherwise support or improve use of the {_Cloud_Service}. Account data is all information (which may be further described in an {_Attachment_or_TD}) about {P2.Handle} or its users provided to or collected by {P1.Handle} (including through tracking and other technologies, such as cookies) which is processed in accordance with the {P1.Handle} Online Privacy Statement available at www.ibm.com/privacy/details/us/en/.
