2.sec=If a {_third_party} asserts a claim against {P2.Handle} that an {_P1.Product} acquired under {_the_Agreement} infringes a patent or copyright, {P1.Handle} will defend {P2.Handle} against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against {P2.Handle} or included in a settlement approved by {P1.Handle}, provided that {P2.Handle} promptly (i) notifies {P1.Handle} in writing of the claim, (ii) supplies information requested by {P1.Handle}, and (iii) allows {P1.Handle} to control, and reasonably cooperates in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts.
