Ti=Termination

sec=Either {_party} may terminate this agreement i) without cause on at least one month’s notice to the other after expiration or termination of its obligations under {_the_Agreement}; or ii) immediately for cause if the other is in material breach of {_the_Agreement}, provided the one who is not complying is given notice and reasonable time to comply. Failure to pay is a material breach. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond {_the_Agreement} termination remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to successors and assignees. Termination of this agreement does not terminate {_TDs}, and provisions of this agreement and Attachments as they relate to such {_TDs} remain in effect until fulfilled or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms. {P1.Handle} may terminate {P2.Handle}’s license to use a {_Program} or {_MC} if {P2.Handle} fails to comply with {_the_Agreement}. {P2.Handle} will promptly destroy all copies of the {_Program} or {_MC} after either {_party} has terminated the license.
