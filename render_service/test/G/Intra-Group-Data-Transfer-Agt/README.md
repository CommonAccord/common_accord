# Intra-Group-Data-Transfer-Agt

This is a form of data sharing framework agreement contributed by DLA Piper for data transfers among companies within a corporate group.  It has a very carefully worked-out structure that anticipates group-level agreement on certain matters, with extensive use of annexes to configure relationships and data flows. 

It could serve as a starting point for a general framework for data sharing.
