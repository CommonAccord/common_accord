Ti=Artificial Intelligence

1.sec=Artificial Intelligence is one area I think a lot about. Clearly it's on the minds of many of my peers as well.

2.sec=At its core, this technology promises to learn from people individually to benefit us all. Yet advancing AI by collecting huge personal profiles is laziness, not efficiency. For artificial intelligence to be truly smart, it must respect human values, including privacy.

3.sec=If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound.

4.sec=We can achieve both great artificial intelligence and great privacy standards. It's not only a possibility, it is a responsibility.

5.sec=In the pursuit of artificial intelligence, we should not sacrifice the humanity, creativity and ingenuity that define our human intelligence.

00.sec=And at Apple, we never will.
