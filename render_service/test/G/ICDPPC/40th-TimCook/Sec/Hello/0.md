Ti=Hello

0.sec=Good morning.

1.sec=It is an honor to be here with you today in this grand hall, a room that represents what is possible when people of different backgrounds, histories and philosophies come together to build something bigger than themselves.

2.sec=I am deeply grateful to our hosts. I want to recognize Ventsislav Karadjov for his service and leadership. And it's a true privilege to be introduced by his co-host, a statesman I admire greatly, Giovanni Butarelli.

3.sec=Now Italy has produced more than its share of great leaders and public servants. Machiavelli taught us how leaders can get away with evil deeds, and Dante showed us what happens when they get caught.

4.sec=Giovanni has done something very different. Through his values, his dedication, his thoughtful work, Giovanni, his predecessor Peter Hustinx — and all of you — have set an example for the world. We are deeply grateful.
