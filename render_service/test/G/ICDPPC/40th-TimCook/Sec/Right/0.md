Ti=Right

0.sec=There and everywhere, it should be rooted in four essential rights:

Shrunk.Ti=First, the right to have personal data minimized.

Shrunk.sec=Companies should challenge themselves to de-identify customer data â€” or not to collect it in the first place.

Shrunk.=[G/Z/ol/Base]

Assent.Ti=Second, the right to knowledge.

Assent.sec=Users should always know what data is being collected and what it is being collected for. This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn't. Anything less is a sham.

Assent.=[G/Z/ol/Base]

Access.Ti=Third, the right to access.

Access.sec=Companies should recognize that data belongs to users, and we should all make it easy for users to get a copy of, correct and delete their personal data.

Access.=[G/Z/ol/Base]

Safe.Ti=And fourth, the right to security.

Safe.sec=Security is foundational to trust and all other privacy rights.

Safe.=[G/Z/ol/Base]
