The first folder here has a list of all the deal points for <i>both</i> an Equity Seed Round and a Note Seed Round.   It also has little patches for adjusting the various documents. <br>Then there is a closing binder for the Equity transaction, then the closing binder for the Note transaction.<br>That way, everything is in the same place, compact and machine readable.  Good for doing other deals.
