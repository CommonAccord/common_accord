Ti=Perishable Goods

1.sec=On receipt of the shipment {shipment} the importer {importer} pays the grower {grower} {unitPrice} USD per {unit}. The shipment must contain between {minUnits} and {maxUnits} {unit} of {product}.

2.sec=Shipping containers used must be temperature controlled, and temperature readings must be logged at least {temperatureReadingFrequency} per {duration}.

3.sec=Shipments that arrive after {dueDate} are to be considered spoiled and must be arranged to be returned to or disposed of by grower at cost to grower.

4.sec=Shipments that have a temperature reading less than the agreed minimum temperature of {minTemperature} degrees centigrade have a price penalty applied calculated using Formula 1 below. The minimum breach penalty factor to be used is {minPenaltyFactor}.

5.sec=Shipments that have a temperature reading greater than the agreed maximum temperature of {maxTemperature} degrees centigrade have a price penalty applied calculated using Formula 2 below. The maximum breach penalty factor to be used is {maxPenaltyFactor}.

6.0.sec=Formula 1: Maximum Temperature Breach Penalty:

6.1.sec=penalty = number of shipment units x difference between maximum temperature and agreed maximum temperature x maximum breach penalty factor

6.=[G/Z/ol-none/s1]

7.0.sec=Formula 2: Minimum Temperature Breach Penalty:

7.1.sec=penalty = number of shipment units x difference between minimum temperature and agreed minimum temperature x minimum breach penalty factor

7.=[G/Z/ol-none/s1]

=[G/Z/ol/s7]
