The Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House) developed the Model Agreement for Sharing the Data and Benefits of Public Health Surveillance as general guidance. Any use of the Model Agreement must be tailored to a specific data sharing arrangement and is the responsibility of the organizations creating a data sharing arrangement.  Chatham House makes no warranty the Model Agreement is legally appropriate for any specific data sharing arrangement and accepts no legal liability for use of the Model Agreement in data sharing arrangements. Users of the Model Agreement should obtain legal advice specific to the participants and circumstances of their data sharing arrangement and the legal rights and liabilities that might arise from such data sharing arrangements.
