Note=Article 5 Annotation: A ‘good practice’ gleaned from successful data sharing efforts involves identifying intellectual property rights implicated by data sharing activities and agreeing how the parties will handle such rights. This provision involves the development of a management plan for intellectual property rights (included as Annex C of the Model Agreement) for each data sharing activity planned. The management plan requires identification of intellectual property rights affected or created by data sharing (e.g. copyright in the data produced and shared) and a description of how rights will be assigned and exploited. Effective management of intellectual property rights can play a role in benefits sharing (see Article 6 below).
