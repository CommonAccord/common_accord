Note=Article 3.2 Annotation: Those involved in data sharing activities should decide and declare whether they want their respective responsibilities to be voluntary undertakings or legally binding obligations. The Model Agreement instructs the parties to make this choice in the description of data sharing activities in Annex A and to provide specific information (e.g. the governing law) for activities the parties want to be legally binding. The Model Agreement is designed to work for both binding and non-binding data sharing arrangements. The decision to make a data sharing agreement legally binding will create additional issues, including the advisability of engaging legal counsel in preparing or reviewing the data sharing agreement and the consequences of a legally binding agreement for settling disputes (see Article 7.1 below). The Agreement should be compliant with the laws of the countries involved, irrespective of whether the data sharing arrangements are binding or not.
