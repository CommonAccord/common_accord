Note=Article 7.1 Annotation: Data providers and data recipients will need to manage disputes that can arise in undertaking data sharing activities. Disputes can be resolved in many ways, and the Model Agreement does not contain an exhaustive range of dispute settlement options. Whatever dispute resolution process is used, the parties should agree on how they will handle disputes that might emerge in cooperating on data sharing. Note that the choice to make a data sharing agreement legally binding (see Article 3.2 above) will affect how disputes under such binding agreements can be resolved.
